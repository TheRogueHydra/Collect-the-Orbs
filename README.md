# Collect-the-Orbs
A small game made with the Pygame framework for Python. Check readme for instructions.

# Controls
Up Arrow Key: Boost up.
Down Arrow Key: Boost down.
X Key: Reset the position of the purple crate.

# How to Play
Collect as much charge as you can by colliding with the purple crates.
If you fall in the red "dead zone", you lose charge.
If your charge drops below 0, you lose the game.
If your purple crate falls into the dead zone, press the "X" key to reset its position.
When you collide with the purple crate, the dead zone can either rise or fall, so be alert.

Run the main.py file to play.
